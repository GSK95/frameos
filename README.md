Hello there,

This is something i've started by learning QT...yes...u read it correct. 
I wanted out from curiosity to start learning this SDK and make something nice.
Idea is basically to have an enviroment that can act like regullar desktop, but it has alot of interesting features such as, no need to download additional programs for some file types, or You want to enjoy some internet time without heavy duty webbrowsers.
